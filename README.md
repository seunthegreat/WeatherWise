# WeatherWise

WeatherWise is a React.js application built using Typescript that displays weather for a list of cities on the map. 
The map feature was implemented with the help of a package called Mapbox, and the application's responsiveness was made using Tailwind CSS. 
It is important to note that the project was built using Vite. Additionally, the 'react-select' dependency was used to handle search input 
of the user asynchronously.
